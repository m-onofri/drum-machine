# Drum Machine

In this project I created a simple drum machine. This drum machine has some buttons associated to different drum sounds.
This project is from freeCodeCamp course and it's based on the React library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/drum-machine.git
```

Install the packages:
```
cd drum-machine
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/, and have a look at the app.


# ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at the app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/drum-machine/).


## Main features

* Each button of the drum machine is associated with a specific drum sound.
* You can activate each sound either by clicking the corresponding button or by pushing the associated key on the keyboard.
* There is a display showing which sound is performed.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
